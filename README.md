# my-etch-a-sketch-project
This is my second time creating this project per The Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch Project lesson. I struggled to understand it the first time, and I think it will be fun to give it a second try to see how I've grown. 

In this project, I need to make a 16x16 grid whose squares change color (like an etch-a-sketch/sketchbook) when I mouseover (draw) on them.

I think I'll create an array with 16 elements and then use flexbox magic to align them into a grid. In THEORY I'm fairly excited and believe I have a fair understanding of how to change the color of each element using :hover. 
In my first iteration of this project, the squares immediately changed color on hover; this time I don't want them to change until I click/drag the mouse. 
I will need to be able to use user input to determine the size of the grid, max size being 100. With a simple prompt and createGrid using ${userInput}, I think this will be managable.
The extra credit is to 1. add a rainbow drawing method, and 2. a brush method that gets progressively 10% darker as it's used.
